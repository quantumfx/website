I am teaching drop-in beginner classes for [UT-Swing](https://linktr.ee/utswing) on the first and third Monday of the month at the [Imperial Pub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Hy1oeSrqAXMKK7Et5), as well as occasionally for [Drom Taberna](https://www.dromtaberna.com/)'s swing dance Tuesdays.

From Sept. 12 to Oct. 24 I am also teaching the [beginner](https://swingtoronto.com/courses/#st-cshagbegctfeq2023n_rev) and [intermediate](https://swingtoronto.com/courses/#st-cshagintctfeq2023n_rev) College Shag classes at [Swing Toronto](https://swingtoronto.com/).
